Trivia Game

### Description

This app displays a short Trivia Game, with questions about situation comedies. The
project leverages the use of intervals, both setTimeout and setInterval, to control
the game flow.

### Methodology

For the implementation of the game, I used an array of objects as the main data 
structure. Each object contains the trivia game's question, its choices, the correct 
answer index, as well as an image relevant to the sitcom being mentioned.

Similar to the slide show, the game's flow control is managed by setInterval and
setTimeout calls to the displayQuestion and displayAnswer functions.

### About

The project utilizes the bootstrap and jquery libraries. The main code for the game 
is located in the `./assets/js directory`; the file is named `app.js`. The `style.css`
complements the `bootstrap 4` library by adding custom classes and id's.
